## Introduction
The Counter Phishing Tool is a Python-based tool tailored to inundate phishing websites with fake credentials. By proactively overwhelming them with bogus data, it aims to disrupt and thwart phishing scams before they can ensnare unsuspecting users.

## Features
- **Credential Generation**: Generates a plethora of random names, emails, passwords, etc., to mimic real users.
- **Automated Login Attempts**: Automatically bombards login pages of phishing websites with the generated credentials.
- **Configurable Threads**: Supports threading for efficient parallel processing.
- **Customizable**: Allows customization of the login form data payload.
- **Test Server**: Used to verify logger functionality and show how your payload is being viewed on a simple http server.

## Scriptable formdata payload
The `form_data.json` file contains the payload to be sent to the phishing website's login form. The payload should be modified according to the login form fields of the phishing website. The following is an example of a payload for a login form with fields for `email` and `password`:

### Example
```json
{
  "foo": 69,
  "email": "@RANDOM_EMAIL",
  "password": "@RANDOM_PASSWORD",
  "bar": false
}
```

### Supported Keywords

- `@RANDOM_EMAIL`: Generates a random email address.
- `@RANDOM_NUMBER`: Generates a random number.
- `@RANDOM_DIGIT`: Generates a random digit.
- `@RANDOM_BOOLEAN`: Generates a random boolean.
- `@RANDOM_FULLNAME`: Generates a random full name.
- `@RANDOM_FIRSTNAME`: Generates a random first name.
- `@RANDOM_FIRSTNAME_MALE`: Generates a random male first name.
